      <h1 style="color:darkblue">Thinking of solar power for your business? There’s never been a better time.</h1>
        <p>Clean, quiet and affordable, commercial solar is revolutionising the way thousands of companies across Australia do business. Solar empowers you to take one of your essential business components - your building, site or factory - and make it work even harder for you by reducing both energy costs and your carbon impact.</p>
      <div>Making the decision to rely less on grid power is a smart way to protect your operational budget from unprecedented future energy volatility. With an energy market that continues to rise and fall, you can expect to see drastic changes to your expenses over the coming years.


Removing your reliance on the grid means having more control over your anticipated energy costs, and when combined with our other services such as tariff and demand analysis, you could soon be looking at saving thousands of dollars each month, with minimum effort.</div>
      <h1 style="color:darkblue">Your high quality commercial solar system could be cash flow positive from day one</h1>
      <p>We aim to make your commercial solar solution cash-flow positive for your business by offsetting the cost through government grants and projected savings on your electricity bill.

This means, if solar stacks up for your business, you won't need to come up with a separate budget for your solution. You'll pay the same amount or less for your electricity and simply use the savings that you are generating by having solar to fund the system.

The cost savings of solar could also free up your operational budget to invest in a solar battery system when it becomes commercially viable for you. Learn more about solar batteries here.</p>

{#      <h1>Your Commercial Solar System with Choice Energy</h1>#}
  <br><br>
      <h1 style="color:darkblue">Why smart businesses are choosing commercial solar energy</h1>
      <ul>
          <li><h5>Better energy efficiency. The difference to your bottom line in terms of energy spend could be as significant as tens of thousands of dollars saved each year.</h5></li><br>
      <li><h5>Your new energy consumption profile could result in a new network tariff, meaning even further energy cost reductions.</h5></li><br>
          <li><h5>You’re protected against future energy costs and fluctuations.</h5></li><br>
          <li><h5>You’ve got a competitive advantage ahead of your wholesale grid-dependent. competitors once your system is paid off. The power you generate is all yours!</h5></li><br>
          <li><h5>You’ve got a back-up power source in the event of a daytime interruption.</h5></li><br>
          <li><h5>Solar is a transportable energy solution that can be moved to a new site if required.</h5></li><br>

      <h1 style="color:darkblue">It’s easy to understand why so many Australian homes choose to invest in solar energy.</h1>
      <p>Clean, efficient and cost reducing, a solar energy system can be an ideal solution for most families and households. With dramatic forecasted changes in not only the cost of energy, but also the way and times we utilise energy in the home, it makes sense to look into cheaper, environmentally friendly investments.

A residential solar system can provide peace of mind for you and your family as the cost of living rises. Freeing yourself from complete grid reliance means generating clean and free energy via your roof, lessening those bills and lowering your carbon footprint while you’re at it.

      <p>
          It’s important to us that your solar system is not only right for you now, but also right for you into the future. For this reason, we only work with high quality manufacturers from across the globe to ensure your residential solar panels, inverter and all cabling and wires are well produced, and designed to last. With financing options available that often make paying your system off equal or less of the value of your energy bills, you’ll find investing in a premium system more affordable than you might think.

When choosing your solar provider, it’s essential to ensure you are working with a Clean Energy Council approved retailer, especially if you are a Victorian resident. Not only are we CEC approved, but also the solar partner of choice for a range of industry groups.

      </h1>
      <p>
          There is a range of funding and investment programs aimed at supporting renewable energy sources like solar. Factoring these cost reductions in can be challenging unless you’re across the spectrum of energy subsidies available at any one point in time, but worth the benefit in terms of money saved on your new system.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>This is why so many businesses and individuals choose to partner with Choice Energy for high quality solar: We make the system seamless, including the process of identifying and applying for relevant grants and incentives.</p>

          An overview on current Government Targets and Schemes
      </h1>
      <p>
          Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) is a government policy aiming to see at least 33,0000 gigawatts of energy from renewable energy by 2020. The RET scheme ultimately encourages the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector, and consists of two parts: Large Scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) and the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES)

          What else do I need to know about these grants?
      </h1>
      <ul>
          <li>The RET STC certificate scheme is being slowly phased out between now and 2030. This means with each passing year, you’ll receive less certificates for your system. This is why we often encourage individuals or businesses to act promptly on their decision to invest in energy: The faster you act, the higher your rebate may be, as well as, of course, your business or home bills benefitting from cost-free, clean solar energy.</li>
          <li>The value of the certificates fluctuates. For small-scale technology certificates, this is capped at $40 per certificate, and at their lowest have been valued at $16. Akin to a stock market, this value is proportionate to supply and demand.</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    <bold>
        These mitigating factors are why we always recommend choosing solar by an energy management company like Choice Energy.

      <br><br>
        <h1 style="color: darkblue">What is power factor, and why is it relevant to my energy bill costs?</h1>
        <p>
            Your power factor is a measure of how efficiently all the equipment at your site uses the electricity supplied by the network distributor. It is the ratio of the working power (kW) your equipment at your site is actually using, to the power (kVA) the network distributor has allocated to your site to ensure there is enough power to keep your business running through those peak loads.
        </p>

            Power Factor Correction for Large Market Customers

        <br>

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">If you’re a large market customer, you’re charged for demand in the electricity network charges section of your electricity bill.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">This demand charge is for the maximum kilowatt (kW) or kilovolt-amps (kVA) that a network distributor has made available to cover peak loads of your operations on each site.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"> This is calculated based on your power usage pattern. If this buffer of electricity supply sits idle, you’re still charged a fee for it being available to you.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Porta ac consectetur ac</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Vestibulum at eros</li>
</ul>
        <br>

        <p>Think of a power factor measure a little like a mobile data plan.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The mobile data you actually use is like your working power (or kW), and your mobile phone plan commitment of $49 per month is like your kVA (the amount of data your mobile phone provider is giving you access to).</p>
        <br>
        <p>You may pay for 30GB of data every month, but only use 20GB of data. Yet, you’ll be billed the full $49 you’ve committed to. In this case, we would aim to reduce your charges by a third and only pay for the 20GB, or $32.

    Energy-saving light-emitting diode (LED) lighting can positively transform your work environments and significantly cut the costs of lighting and maintenance.
</h3>

           <br>
           <p>
               If your work sites are using old lighting technology, chances are your energy bill is being hit hard. Choice Energy could help lower your lighting costs with an energy efficient solution.

               Commercial LED lighting benefits
           </h1>
           <br>
           <p>Here is why a tailored LED lighting solution is an important part of the overall energy-saving solution for your business.</p>
           <br>
       <ul>
              <li><h3 style="color: darkblue">
               Pay less for lighting
           </h3>
           </li>
       </ul>
<br>
           <p>
               LED bulbs use a fraction of the power of old lighting technology such as compact fluorescent or incandescent bulbs. Replacing inefficient lighting with LED lighting will mean you’ll use less power and pay less for it.
           </p>
           <br>
       <ul>
           <li>
               <h3 style="color:darkblue;">
                   Cut back on maintenance
               </h3>
           </li>
       </ul>
           <br>
           <p>
               With LED bulbs your maintenance savings will be significantly less. Consider this. From the time you turn on the lights, compact fluorescents lose 20 to 30% of their light output. LED lights stay consistent. Better still, LED bulbs will outlast compact fluorescents or incandescent bulbs five- to ten-fold.
           </p>
<br>
           <ul>
               <li>

               </li>
           </ul>
<br>
           <p>
               With an LED lighting solution, the intensity of light, referred to as luminous flux (lux) per unit area, can be tailored for purpose. For example, 400 lux is about right for an office space or learning in an educational setting but would be insufficient for a manufacturing floor.

           <br>
           <p>
               We’ll help deliver optimal lighting based on the purpose of each of your working environments. Getting lighting right can improve productivity and safety as well as enhance the experience for customers if you have retail or meeting spaces.

           </ul>
           <br>
           <p>Your LED lighting solution can include putting in light sensors and sophisticated controls and interfaces to help manage energy efficiency. You’ll use less and pay less.</p>
<br>

           </ul>
           <br>
           <p>
               There are great state-based government subsidies available to incentivise the use of energy efficient lighting.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               Once you turn on LED lighting and use less energy, over time your energy management consultant will review your network tariff, potentially resulting in further cost savings.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               LED lighting will protect your business from the cost impacts of future energy price rises.

                                        An energy supplier or energy retailer provides your site with power - usually the group with the logo on your energy bill. Suppliers are here to offer you deals on how much you pay (per kWh) on your electricity, in either a fixed term or rolling contract. For those seeking energy solutions for the home, it can be tempting to utilise comparison websites, or simply assume your provider is giving you the best deal possible.

                                        Energy comparison with a seasoned energy management specialist, however, puts the power back in your corner to find and secure the best deal possible.

                                        Large power users have complex monthly bill charges and higher exposure to potential costly mistakes. Most businesses aren’t aware there are multiple companies who pass on charges to your energy retailer for them to model and pass on to you. Unfortunately, this commonly leads to incorrect bill charges, be it overcharges or undercharges.

                                        By default, you have a metering charge on your energy bill from which you receive zero value in return. Shield metering and monitoring is simply added to your metering charge, and at the same time provides you with insights, reports and a dedicated account manager that put you back in control of your business energy needs. This continued value empowers you with the opportunity to validate energy bills, and continually monitor your energy usage without stress - simply set and forget, and let us identify the strengths and weaknesses.

                                        For businesses that spend more than $2500 per month, these charges are often split out as a line item on your bill and are negotiable. When your retailer passes on these charges, they don’t usually go out of their way to tap you on the shoulder and correct you if you’re paying more than what you need to be - and that’s where we come in.

                                        How can network tariffs affect my bills?
                                    </h1>
                                    <p>
                                        While distributors are the owners of the infrastructure that supplies power to your site, tariff charges are set by the government regulator — the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) — and reviewed annually on a five-year forecast.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>
                                        But distributors regularly bid to the government about how much of their supply and infrastructure costs they’ll recover through these regular network tariff variations. This means new tariff variations are available for consideration each year, despite your business energy network tariff classification possibly being set years ago.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>
                                        Your tariff can be affected by these variations because your tariff no longer reflects the energy demand your site requires to function. For example, you may have previously utilised a piece of machinery for 12+ hours, whereas now you have innovated with new technology, or perhaps you have moved part of your energy-intensive business to another location. This has greatly lowered your demand requirements, and potentially qualified you for a new tariff classification without you realising it.
